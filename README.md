# Crucible (Working Title)

"Crucible" (working title) is an innovative and modern tabletop roleplaying game system to empower rich storytelling with compelling mechanics on digital gaming platforms.

## System Goals

There are several primary goals of this RPG system which I hope can serve a valuable purpose within the landscape of available rulesets. 

1. <SYSTEM> provides an engine that is flexible and customizable to provide a compelling mechanical framework that is easily tailored by the Game Master to fit the needs of his or her narrative setting. 

2. The system is purposefully designed to be best experienced using virtual tabletop (VTT) software to manage aspects of dice rolling and book-keeping which could be cumbersome using traditional pen-and-paper materials.

3. The system places a high emphasis on mechanical consistency and enabling diversity of character concepts through a classless system with multiple vertical pillars of character progression. These mechanics allow for crunchy encounters with inherent tools for combat, puzzle-solving, and social challenges.
4. <SYSTEM> is optimized and designed with extended-form narrative in mind. While it can be used for one-shot adventures, the system's mechanics are intended to play out over the course of months or years of gameplay.

### Non-Goals

This system provides relatively little rule-based guidance around narrative, personal character story, or the development of intrapersonal relationships - deliberately leaving these narrative pillars for the Game Master and players to explore using whatever setting or storytelling style they most prefer.

> This system does not include a canonical setting and could be used in any narrative setting of your choice, whether it be an existing realm or a purely homebrewed universe. As general advice, these rules will work best in gritty fantasy settings.
