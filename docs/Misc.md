## Maintaining or Resisting Active Effects

Many Talents and Spells feature sustained effects which last for some duration. Such abilities may require additional checks to maintain an effect of or to resist the an effect which currently afflicts the hero. 

#### Resistance Check

To resist an active effect, roll an Arcane Defense check of the specific type and compare the result against the target's passive Spell Power, for example to resist an effect which targets Fortitude:

| Defender Rolls a Fortitude Check                  | vs. Attacker's Passive Spell Power         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ```3d8 + Fortitude Defense + Situational Bonus``` | ```12 + Spell Power + Situational Bonus``` |

#### Maintenance Check

To maintain an active effect, roll a Spell Power check and compare the result against the target's passive Arcane Defense, for example to maintain an effect which targets Willpower:

| Attacker Rolls a Spell Power Check          | vs. Defenders Passive Willpower                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ```3d8 + Spell Power + Situational Bonus``` | ```12 + Willpower Defense + Situational Bonus``` |

To choose which type of check to use, apply the following decision rules:

1. If the relevant Talent or Spell explicitly states whether to use a Resistance Check or a Maintenance Check, follow the instructions in that specific rule.
2. If the contest is between a character (a Player) and a non-player character (the Game Master), use the type of check which allows the player to roll against the NPC's passive value.
3. If the contest is between two players, or two NPCs the Game Master may decide which type of check is more appropriate for the narrative.

## Damage Types, Resistances, and Vulnerabilities

Inevitably, defenses will be breached and both heroes and their foes will end up sustaining damage from attacks and hazards. Each source of damage in <SYSTEM> belongs to one or multiple of the following 10 types:

#### Physical Damage Types

**Bludgeoning**. Blunt force trauma which causes crushing and breaking of bones.

**Piercing**. Puncturing attacks which pierce flesh or armor to damage vital organs.

**Slashing**. Lacerations and tearing from sharp implements.

#### Elemental Damage Types

**Acid**. Caustic burns or poisonous reactions.

**Fire.** Burning and immolation.

**Frost.** Chilling and freezing.

**Lightning**. System shock from electrocution.

#### Spiritual Damage Types

**Psychic**. Mental strain and psychosis.

**Radiant**. Divine energy and radiation.

**Unholy**. Corruptive energy and decay.

Different creatures in the world have differing resilience and susceptibility against certain types of damage, and equipment worn by characters may also provide added protections.

#### Damage Resistance

Damage Resistance (DR) occurs when a creature is naturally or magically hardened against a certain type of attack. For example a formidable Frost Giant is accustomed to living in frigid conditions and is inherently resistant to Frost damage. Resistance is defined as a numeric value which is subtracted from the total damage result, to a minimum of zero, before Wounds are dealt.

#### Damage Vulnerability

Damage Vulnerability (DV) occurs when a creature is naturally or magically susceptible to a certain type of attack. That same deadly Frost Giant would also likely be vulnerable to Fire damage as a polar opposite of it's environmental affinity. Vulnerability is defined as a numeric value which is added to the total damage result before Wounds are dealt.

#### Everything has a Weakness

A key design guideline for Game Masters in <SYSTEM> is that, outside of exceptional situations, every creature should have at least one Resistance and at least one Vulnerability, which serves to reward players for preparedness and to incentivize the adaptation of tactics during battle.

> As a general rule of thumb, creatures of higher challenge tiers should have more resistances and fewer vulnerabilities. Furthermore, Vulnerability values should be generally half of resistance values. The following two tables provide general Game Master guidance for creature DR/DV attributes.

| Challenge Tier | Maximum Resistances and Vulnerabilities |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Normal         | 1 Resistance, 2 Vulnerabilities         |
| Elite          | 2 Resistances, 2 Vulnerabilities        |
| Legendary      | 4 Resistances, 1 Vulnerability          |
| Deity          | 6 Resistances, 0 Vulnerabilities        |

| Creature Level | Max. Resistance Value | Max. Vulnerability Value |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1-5            | 5                     | 3                        |
| 6-10           | 10                    | 5                        |
| 11-15          | 20                    | 10                       |
| 16-20          | 40                    | 20                       |

> As an example, a level 8 Elite Ogre Berserker might have DR 10/Bludgeoning, DR 10/Psychic, DV 5/Frost, and DV 5/Unholy. It is acceptable to give creatures more or fewer resistances and vulnerabilities than is otherwise recommended if their other attributes are adjusted to compensate for the altered challenge level.

## Temporary Conditions

**Blinded (Blind)**.

**Bloodied (Near Death).** When you fall below 50% of your effective maximum hit points you acquire the Bloodied condition. Different heroes and creatures respond to being bloodied differently - some weaken or become afraid as their wounds mount, while others rise to adversity becoming frenzied with a lust for battle. Many creatures have abilities which specifically target bloodied foes, or only may be used when they themselves have the Bloodied condition.

**Staggered (Prone).**

**Flanked (Surrounded).**

**Restrained (Pinned)**.

**Entangled (Ensnared)**.

**Paralyzed (Petrified).**

**Silenced (Mute).**

**Unconscious (Dead).**

#### Physical Afflictions

**Bleeding**.

**Poisoned.**

**Diseased.**

**Burning.**

**Frozen**.

**Stunned.**

#### Mental Afflictions

**Afraid.**

**Dominated.**

**Confused.**
