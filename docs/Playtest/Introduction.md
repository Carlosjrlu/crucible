# Playtest Introduction

Welcome to the **Crucible Playtest**, thank you for helping me to test the system at this early stage.

The goals of the current phase of the playtest are testing:

1. Character Creation
2. Non-Magical Combat

## Character Creation Testing
A primary goal of the playtest is testing the mechanics of character creation. We will start by taking some time to create new characters.

> Be sure to ask questions as you go in order to understand how various character creation choices affect the way that your playtest character will function.

### Character Creation Steps
To create a new character, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Actor using the **hero** type.
2. Choose an [[Ancestry]] from the Compendium or Items sidebar and add itto the character sheet via drag-and-drop.
3. Choose a [[Background]] from the Compendium or Items sidebar and add it to the character sheet via drag-and-drop.
4. Spend available Ability Points by increasing the scores of your [[Abilities]]. It is not required to spend all points.
5. Spend available Skill Points by increasing your ranks in various [[Skills]]. You do not need to spend all points.
6. Choose [[Talents]] for your character from the Compendium or Items sidebar and add them via drag-and-drop.
7. Once you are done with character creation, set your character to Level 1 and begin your adventure!

## Combat Testing
A secondary goal of the playtest is to begin testing the mechanics of (non-magical) combat. A full range of physical combat options are available including unarmed, melee, ranged, sword+shield, and more.

As we start getting into the combat portion of testing, it may be helpful for you to consult with documentation on [[Initiative and Turn Order]] and [[Rounds, Turns, and Phases]].

To test combat, we will play through a brief scenario with multiple combat encounters!
