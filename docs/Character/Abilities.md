# Ability Scores

A character's ability scores describe facets of physical and mental capability. All dice checks are modified, in one way or another, by at least one of your ability scores.

Each ability has an ability score, which ranges from 1 to 12, where the typical value of an attribute for a non-adventuring Human is 3. Characters may have scores that are as low as 1, but a score of 1 typically indicates an exceptional weakness compared to their peers. An ability score of 12 is reserved for supernatural entities, great monsters, or heroes who are nigh unparalleled in their power.

#### Strength
