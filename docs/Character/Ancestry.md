# Character Ancestry

Your Ancestry reflects your genetic heritage, where different races of the world innately possess different physical abilities, traditional skills, and innate talents. Each ancestry adds to your character attribute scores, provides two traditional skills, and optionally alters your characters resistances and vulnerabilities.

At character creation each player will select an ancestry which determines some aspects of your appearance, attributes, and skills.

Each Ancestry has both a primary ability score, which starts at +3, and a secondary ability score, which starts at +2. All other ability scores should be set to +1 before ability scores are purchased.

Each Ancestry also has two traditional skills, which start at Novice Rank. Additionally, an Ancestry may have both a Damage Resistance and a Damage Vulnerability. A Resistance gives +3 Resistance to one type of damage, while the Vulnerability gives -3 Resistance to one type of damage.

## Traditional Ancestries

The table below presents some example Ancestries which will be familiar for many fantasy RPG settings.

| Ancestry  | Primary Ability (+3) | Secondary Ability (+2) | Skills                       | Damage Resistance | Damage Vulnerability |

| Human     | Charisma             | Strength               | Deception, Diplomacy         | None              | None                 |

| Dragonkin | Charisma             | Intelligence           | Diplomacy, Intimidation      | Fire              | Acid                 |

> As a Game Master and storyteller, you should create, alter, or remove ancestry options to suit the story of your world. When creating a custom Ancestry, ensure that they have one primary ability score and one secondary ability score. Choose two Skills which provide a free rank, and choose two tier 1 Talents which would be otherwise available to a level 1 character. Also, you can optionally choose a Resistance and Vulnerability to two separate damage types, which gives a +3 and -3 resistance to those damage types, respectively. For balance, an Ancestry should have either both a Resistance and a Vulnerability, or neither.

## Unconventional Ancestry

Role-playing games often follow the stories of heroes who are exceptional or different, even among other's of the character's race. A player may wish to play a particularly unintelligent gnome, or a frail orc, who excel in other ways, and find the Primary or Secondary Abilities would not reflect the idea the player has for their character. Similarly, many character backstories are those of orphans, who were raised by creatures of another race or culture. An orphaned elf character who was raised by humans may have no background in learning the traditional elven skills of Perception or Arcana. If this is the case, a Game Master may wish to employ the following rule.

At the Game Master's discretion, a player may be allowed to select their own Primary and Secondary Abilities, as well as the two skills that gain a free rank. These choices overwrite the ability scores and skills normally given by an Ancestry.
