# Character Creation

The character creation process in <SYSTEM> follows a familiar pattern for those familiar with other pen-and-paper systems.

## Character Levels

<SYSTEM> uses the concept of character levels to represent the growth of your hero's powers and abilities over the course of their adventuring career. It is assumed that newly created characters begin at level 1, but this is not mandatory and the Game Master may choose to begin a new campaign at an alternative power level, or even mix-and-match characters of different power levels into the same party.

## Character Creation Decisions

When creating your character, you make a number of key decisions - some of which are irrevocable - so it is advisable to consider these choices carefully.

1. **Ancestry.** Choose your character's genealogical ancestry which determines some aspects of your physical appearance, attributes, and skills.
2. **Background.** Choose a character background which augments or complements the narrative backstory for your hero. Backgrounds affect your character's skills and starting resources.
3. **Ability Scores.** Choose the initial values for your physical and mental ability scores by purchasing points from an allowed pool. Ability scores and other attributes are described in the [Character Attributes](Attributes.md) section.
4. **Skill Levels.** Invest your starting pool of skill points into a set of Skills. Skills are described in the [Character Skills](Skills.md) section.
5. **Starting Talents.** Invest your initial allocation of talent points into a set of starting Talents which are described in the [Character Talents](Talents.md) section.
6. **Appearance, Personality, and Backstory**. A non-required, but strongly encouraged step of character creation is to expand upon your character details with additional background narrative.

## Character Ancestries

Your Ancestry reflects your genetic heritage, where different races of the world innately possess different physical abilities, traditional skills, and innate talents. Each ancestry adds to your character attribute scores, provides two traditional skills, and two innate talents.

Each Ancestry has both a primary ability score, which starts at +3, and a secondary ability score, which starts at +2. All other ability scores should be set to +1 before ability scores are purchased.

Each Ancestry also has two traditional skills, which start at Novice Rank. Additionally, an Ancestry may have both a Damage Resistance and a Damage Vulnerability. A Resistance gives +3 Resistance to one type of damage, while the Vulnerability gives -3 Resistance to one type of damage.

The table below presents some example Ancestries which will be familiar for many fantasy RPG settings.

| Ancestry  | Primary Ability (+3) | Secondary Ability (+2) | Skills                       | Damage Resistance | Damage Vulnerability |
| --------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Human     | Charisma             | Strength               | Deception, Diplomacy         | None              | None                 |
| Elven     | Dexterity            | Intelligence           | Perception, Arcana           | Radiant           | Unholy               |
| Dwarven   | Constitution         | Wisdom                 | Lore, Craftsmanship          | Acid              | Psychic              |
| Orcish    | Strength             | Constitution           | Survival, Intimidation       | Slashing          | Fire                 |
| Giantkin  | Strength             | Constitution           | Perception, Animal Handling  | Bludgeoning       | Psychic              |
| Gnomish   | Intelligence         | Dexterity              | Investigation, Craftsmanship | Psychic           | Lightning            |
| Halfling  | Wisdom               | Dexterity              | Stealth, Lore                | None              | None                 |
| Dragonkin | Charisma             | Intelligence           | Diplomacy, Intimidation      | Fire              | Acid                 |

> As a Game Master and storyteller, you should create, alter, or remove ancestry options to suit the story of your world. When creating a custom Ancestry, ensure that they have one primary ability score and one secondary ability score. Choose two Skills which provide a free rank, and choose two tier 1 Talents which would be otherwise available to a level 1 character. Also, you can optionally choose a Resistance and Vulnerability to two separate damage types, which gives a +3 and -3 resistance to those damage types, respectively. For balance, an Ancestry should have either both a Resistance and a Vulnerability, or neither.

#### Optional Rule: Custom Backgrounds

Role-playing games often follow the stories of heroes who are exceptional or different, even among other's of the character's race. A player may wish to play a particularly unintelligent gnome, or a frail orc, who excel in other ways, and find the Primary or Secondary Abilities would not reflect the idea the player has for their character. Similarly, many character backstories are those of orphans, who were raised by creatures of another race or culture. An orphaned elf character who was raised by humans may have no background in learning the traditional elven skills of Perception or Arcana. If this is the case, a Game Master may wish to employ the following rule.

At the Game Master's discretion, a player may be allowed to select their own Primary and Secondary Abilities, as well as the two skills that gain a free rank. These choices overwrite the ability scores and skills normally given by an Ancestry.

## Character Background

Your Background reflects your upbringing, professional training, career to date, or other aspects of your past before the advent of the campaign's storyline. Your choice of Background further augments your character by adding two Skills, one talent, and a certain amount of starting wealth.

The table below presents some example Backgrounds which will be familiar for many fantasy RPG settings.

| Background       | Skills   | Talents  | Wealth          | Max. Allegiances | Max. Nemeses |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Aristocrat       | 2 skills | 1 talent | Wealthy (10d10) | 1                | 4            |
| Scoundrel        | 2 skills | 1 talent | Average (8d8)   | 2                | 3            |
| Trade Apprentice | 2 skills | 1 talent | Average (8d8)   | 3                | 2            |
| Urchin           | 2 skills | 1 talent | Poor (6d6)      | 4                | 1            |

> As a Game Master and storyteller, you should work with your players to create backgrounds which are suitable for their personal stories. Choose an evocative name, two skills which are representative of the background's past experience, one talent which would have been learned during that time, and a starting wealth level. 

#### Optional Rule: Allegiances and Nemeses

At the discretion of the Game Master, you may employ the Allegiances and Nemeses optional rule which allows you to identify several significant allies or foes from your past. These connections must refer to individual characters or monsters, rather than collective organizations or forces.

If you use this optional rule, you may choose up to the number of starting Allegiances and Nemeses which are allowed by your Background. The starting wealth level of your Background determines the maximum number of Allegiances and Nemeses which you may select at character creation. Each player's Allegiances and Nemeses become tracked entries in the [World Progression](../Narrative/Progression.md) table.

## Assign Ability Scores

With the exception of your Ancestry's Primary and Secondary ability scores, each ability score starts at 1. Begin by applying the modifications granted by your Ancestry. From there, you may spend up to 36 points to develop your attributes further. Each attribute costs an amount of points equal to the level you wish to purchase. For example, to advance your Strength from 4 to 5 costs 5 points.

> It is strongly encouraged to raise all ability scores up to at least 2 or 3. An ability score can remain at 1 should you wish, although be especially wary if you do so as it may place your character at a severe disadvantage.

Suppose your character begins with an Ancestry which provides +3 Constitution and +2 Wisdom; some example point-buy allocations which are possible using this the allowed 36 points are:

| Attribute Value (Cost) | Starting | Standard | Optimized | Min/Max | Balanced |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |-------- | -------- |
| Strength               | 1        | 5 (14)   | 6 (20)    | 7 (27)  | 4 (9)    |
| Dexterity              | 3        | 3 (0)    | 3 (0)     | 3 (0)   | 4 (4)    |
| Constitution           | 1        | 4 (9)    | 4 (9)     | 2 (2)   | 4 (9)    |
| Intelligence           | 1        | 3 (5)    | 2 (2)     | 2 (2)   | 2 (2)    |
| Wisdom                 | 2        | 3 (3)    | 3 (3)     | 3 (3)   | 4 (7)    |
| Charisma               | 1        | 3 (5)    | 2 (2)     | 2 (2)   | 3 (5)    |

## Invest Skill Points 

Your character's starting skills are largely determined by your Ancestry and Background, however you have an additional 2 Skill Points which you may select where to invest at level 1.
