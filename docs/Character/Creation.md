# Character Creation

The character creation process in <SYSTEM> follows a familiar pattern for those familiar with other pen-and-paper systems.

## Character Levels

<SYSTEM> uses the concept of character levels to represent the growth of your hero's powers and abilities over the course of their adventuring career. It is assumed that newly created characters begin at level 1, but this is not mandatory and the Game Master may choose to begin a new campaign at an alternative power level, or even mix-and-match characters of different power levels into the same party.

## Character Creation Decisions

When creating your character, you make a number of key decisions - some of which are irrevocable - so it is advisable to consider these choices carefully.

1. **Ancestry.** Choose your character's genealogical ancestry which determines some aspects of your physical appearance, attributes, and skills.
2. **Background.** Choose a character background which augments or complements the narrative backstory for your hero. Backgrounds affect your character's skills and starting resources.
3. **Ability Scores.** Choose the initial values for your physical and mental ability scores by purchasing points from an allowed pool. Ability scores and other attributes are described in the [Character Attributes](Attributes.md) section.
4. **Skill Levels.** Invest your starting pool of skill points into a set of Skills. Skills are described in the [Character Skills](Skills.md) section.
5. **Starting Talents.** Invest your initial allocation of talent points into a set of starting Talents which are described in the [Character Talents](Talents.md) section.
6. **Appearance, Personality, and Backstory**. A non-required, but strongly encouraged step of character creation is to expand upon your character details with additional background narrative.



## Assign Ability Scores

With the exception of your Ancestry's Primary and Secondary ability scores, each ability score starts at 1. Begin by applying the modifications granted by your Ancestry. From there, you may spend up to 36 points to develop your attributes further. Each attribute costs an amount of points equal to the level you wish to purchase. For example, to advance your Strength from 4 to 5 costs 5 points.

> It is strongly encouraged to raise all ability scores up to at least 2 or 3. An ability score can remain at 1 should you wish, although be especially wary if you do so as it may place your character at a severe disadvantage.

Suppose your character begins with an Ancestry which provides +3 Constitution and +2 Wisdom; some example point-buy allocations which are possible using this the allowed 36 points are:

| Attribute Value (Cost) | Starting | Standard | Optimized | Min/Max | Balanced |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |-------- | -------- |
| Strength               | 1        | 5 (14)   | 6 (20)    | 7 (27)  | 4 (9)    |
| Dexterity              | 3        | 3 (0)    | 3 (0)     | 3 (0)   | 4 (4)    |
| Constitution           | 1        | 4 (9)    | 4 (9)     | 2 (2)   | 4 (9)    |
| Intelligence           | 1        | 3 (5)    | 2 (2)     | 2 (2)   | 2 (2)    |
| Wisdom                 | 2        | 3 (3)    | 3 (3)     | 3 (3)   | 4 (7)    |
| Charisma               | 1        | 3 (5)    | 2 (2)     | 2 (2)   | 3 (5)    |

## Invest Skill Points 

Your character's starting skills are largely determined by your Ancestry and Background, however you have an additional 2 Skill Points which you may select where to invest at level 1.
