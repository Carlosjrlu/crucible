# Character Background

Your Background reflects your upbringing, professional training, career to date, or other aspects of your past before the advent of the campaign's storyline. Your choice of Background further augments your character by adding two Skills, one talent, and a certain amount of starting wealth.

At character creation each player will choose a character background which augments or complements the narrative backstory for your hero. Backgrounds also affect your character's skills and starting resources.

## Standard Backgrounds

The table below presents some example Backgrounds which will be familiar for many fantasy RPG settings.

| Background       | Skills   | Talents  | Wealth          | Max. Allegiances | Max. Nemeses |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Aristocrat       | 2 skills | 1 talent | Wealthy (10d10) | 1                | 4            |
| Scoundrel        | 2 skills | 1 talent | Average (8d8)   | 2                | 3            |
| Trade Apprentice | 2 skills | 1 talent | Average (8d8)   | 3                | 2            |
| Urchin           | 2 skills | 1 talent | Poor (6d6)      | 4                | 1            |

> As a Game Master and storyteller, you should work with your players to create backgrounds which are suitable for their personal stories. Choose an evocative name, two skills which are representative of the background's past experience, one talent which would have been learned during that time, and a starting wealth level. 

## Optional Rule: Allegiances and Nemeses

At the discretion of the Game Master, you may employ the Allegiances and Nemeses optional rule which allows you to identify several significant allies or foes from your past. These connections must refer to individual characters or monsters, rather than collective organizations or forces.

If you use this optional rule, you may choose up to the number of starting Allegiances and Nemeses which are allowed by your Background. The starting wealth level of your Background determines the maximum number of Allegiances and Nemeses which you may select at character creation. Each player's Allegiances and Nemeses become tracked entries in the [World Progression](../Narrative/Progression.md) table.
