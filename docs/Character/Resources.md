# Character Resources

## Physical and Mental Health
Maintaining the physical and mental health of your character is an ever-present challenge. Crucible uses two separate pools to represent the hero's state of wellbeing:

#### Health and Wounds
The physical health of a character is modeled using two resource pools. Health is a temporary resource which begins full and is decreased when a character sustains damage in combat. Wounds are a permanent resource which increase when a character suffers greivous injury.

If the Health pool is reduced to zero, the character becomes **Incapacitated** and begins to suffer Wounds. If the Wounds meter reaches its maximum, the character becomes **Dead**.

#### Morale and Madness
The mental health of a character is similarly modeled using two resource pools. Morale is a temporary resource which begins full and is decreased as the character suffers stress or trauma. Madness is a permanent resource which increases when a character suffers greivous mental strain.

If the Morale pool is reduced to zero, the character becomes **Broken** and begins to suffer Madness. If the Madness meter reaches its maximum, the character becomes **Insane**.

## Capacity for Action
Two resource pools define a character's ability to take action during game situations.

#### Action Points
The pool of Action Points defines a character's capacity for rapid action during each round of a combat encounter. Characters typically have a pool of 3 action points, all three of which replenish at the start of their turn in combat.

#### Focus Points
The pool of Focus Points defines a character's capacity for extraordinary feats of heroism or magic. A character's Focus Points are replenished when they successfully rest, but during the midst of combat a Focus Point pool must be used thoughtfully as it will not normally replenish.
