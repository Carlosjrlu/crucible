All heroes, even at level 1 are capable individuals, they are smart, charismatic, athletic, and skillful - however not to a degree that is wondrous or legendary. As heroes advance they reach tiers of power where their physical, mental, and social capabilities are truly legendary. 

If organizing a gameplay experience that seeks to tell the "origin story" of heroes, starting at level 1 may be an appropriate choice. If you, however, want to jump into an adventure with characters that are already established champions - starting a higher levels is also suitable. 

If starting at higher level, it is recommended that all players come up with a set of short anecdotes for the skill and talent advancements that they have taken prior to the start of the game. This process helps to solidify their character's backstory by anchoring to past events which help explain their current heroic capabilities.

## Character Health

Your Health and Morale pools advance each time you level. Your health formula is given by

```
Health = Level * (Constitution + (0.5 * Strength))

```
