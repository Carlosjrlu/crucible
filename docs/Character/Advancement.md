# Character Development

Character advancement in Crucible is level based. Increases in level grant additional Attribute, Skill, and Talent points which translate into increases in character power level. The maximum character level in <SYSTEM> is 24.

All heroes, even those at level 1, are capable adventurers. They are smart, charismatic, athletic, and skillful - however not to a degree that is wondrous or legendary. As heroes advance they reach tiers of power where their physical, mental, and social capabilities are truly legendary. 

If organizing a gameplay experience that seeks to tell the "origin story" of heroes, starting your game at level 1 is the recommended choice. If, however, you want to jump into an adventure with characters who are already established champions, beginning at a higher level may be more suitable.

> If starting with characters that are not level one, we recommend each player to come up with a series of short anecdotes which explain the skill and talent advancements that their character has unlocked prior to the start of the game. This process helps to solidify their character backstory through past events which help explain their heroic capabilities.

## Character Creation

Each player character starts with an initial allocation of attribute points, skill points, and talent points which they can allocate. A newly created character is considered to be "level zero" until they have completed the character creation process at which point they may advance to level 1.

The initial character creation process involves choosing one **Ancestry** and one **Background** which help to establish the character's backstory and starting attributes. Next you will spend attribute points to increase your **Ability** scores, advance your rank in the starting **Skills** of your choice, and select some beginning **Talents**.

#### Ancestry

Each [Ancestry](./Ancestry.md) has one primary Ability which automatically increases to 3 and one secondary Ability which automatically increases to 2. All other Ability scores begin at 1 prior to the point buy process described in the following section. 

Additionally, each Ancestry defines two traditional Skills which each gain one initial rank. 

Lastly, an Ancestry *may* provide one Damage Resistance and one Damage Vulnerability which denote physiological strengths and weaknesses. This is not required, and many Ancestry options may have neither an initial Resistance nor an initial Vulnerability.

#### Background

Each [Background](./Background.md) defines two acquired Skills which each gain one initial rank. These may be the same as or different than the traditional Skills provided by your Ancestry.

#### Attribute Points

Each character begins with 36 points that can be allocated to the six primary [Ability Scores](./Attributes.md). Each ability score begins at 1, 2, or 3 depending on your ancestry. To increase an ability score you must spend the amount of points equal to the next level of the score. In other words, to advance from a Strength score of 2 to a Strength score of 3 you must spend 3 of your available attribute points. 

You may elect to spend fewer than all 36 attribute points. While your character is still level 0 you may re-allocated your points as much as you want. 

Once you have advanced your character to level 1 the starting ability scores which you purchased can no longer be changed but these ability scores may still be increased over time as you continue to level up.

#### Skill Points

Each character can invest into 16 different [Character Skills](./Skills.md) which represent various competencies and techniques that your character has mastered. Every character will begin with four Skill ranks which were provided by their Ancestry and Background. Additionally, each character begins with two Skill points which are further invested into Skills of the player's choice. The cost to advance your rank in a Skill is described in the Character Skills documentation.

#### Starting Talents

Lastly, each new character has 3 initial [Talent](./Talents.md) points which can be used to choose select powerful abilities that character can perform.

#### Advancing to Level One

Once you have chosen your Ancestry and Background, spent initial Attribute Points, and chosen starting Skills and Talents you may advance your character to level one (or whatever higher level your group is using). Advancing past level zero is a "point of no return", your initial choices are locked but have no fear, there will be ample opportunities to continue growing your character as you further advance in level.

## Character Advancement

Each time you gain a character level after level 1 you can further advance your character's powers and capabilities. Each level grants you:

* 1 Attribute Point which can increase one of your Ability scores by one.
* 2 Skill Points which can be used to purchase additional ranks in Skills.
* 3 Talent Points which can be used to purchase new character Talents.

After gaining a level you should take a moment to invest these points so that you are prepared to face more challenging and heroic tasks.

#### Experience Progression

The Crucible system employs an optional experience progression system.

Encounters to-level = current level + next level.
