# Dice Mechanics

The Crucible is designed specifically for virtual tabletop platforms, but it uses the standard set of role-playing game dice; relying upon 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice for various rolls. These dice are referred to as d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 where a number that precedes the die type (like 4d6) represents the quantity of that die to roll.

When your character performs heroic actions within the world, whether they be feats of martial prowess or clever social maneuvers, the outcomes of the attempted action are discovered by rolling dice.

## The Dice Pool

The standard approach towards determining the outcome of a dice check in Crucible uses a dice pool comprised of three dice, typically 3d8, which are added together. The exact dice used in the pool are modified depending on the **Boons** or **Banes** which apply to the roll. Added to the result of these three dice are Ability, Skill, and Enchantment bonuses which further increase the value of the result. This type of dice roll is referred to as a **Standard Check**.

## Boons & Banes

> A goblin desperately thrusts at an armored human with its damaged, dull blade. An enchanter wishes to haggle with a merchant she has magically charmed. A soldier swings his hammer at the head of a dazed, concussed ogre. When performing a check, a character may find some circumstances shift the odds in their favor. By the same token, other circumstances will hinder a character's odds of success. 

Circumstances which apply beneficial or detrimental forces upon the likelihood of a check being successful are represented as **Boons** and **Banes**, respectively. The number of boons and banes to be applied to a roll are determined before a roll is made, as they directly affect the composition of the dice pool that is used. A single dice pool roll can have no more than 6 boons and 6 banes affecting it.

Each **boon** applied to the check adds a **+1** modifier to the roll and increments the denomination of the first die in the pool by +2, to a maximum of d12. If a die is already a d12 due to other boons, the increase is applied to the next die in the pool. In practical terms, boons upgrade dice making them bigger and more effective.

Each **bane** applied to the check subtracts a **-1** modifier from the roll and decrements the denomination of the last die in the pool by -2, to a minimum of d4. If a die is already a d4 due to other banes, the decrease is applied to the next die in the pool. In practical terms, banes downgrade dice making them smaller and less effective.

Because boons and banes start at opposite ends of the dice pool, they can both affect changes to the same roll. For example, a dice pool with +2 boons and +2 banes would result in `1d12 + 1d8 + 1d4`. However, if more than four Boons and more than four Banes are present their effects will begin to cancel each other out.

#### Situation - Boons Added
Suppose Albert, a naval captain, has had his ship boarded by pirates. By fortunate circumstance, the fierce rocking of the ship has toppled one of the invaders over on the deck of his ship. Advancing towards the sprawling pirate, he draws his blade and slashes down at the unwelcome guest. Attacking such a prone creature confers 2 boons to his attack roll. This upgrades the first die in his 3d8 dice pool twice, from an d8 to a d12, resulting in a dice pool of 1d12 + 2d8. Additionally, each boon gives him a flat +1 modifier to his roll, resulting in a +2 modifier to this attack roll. On top of his +5 Strength Ability Bonus and +6 Skill Bonus in using the sword, his attack roll becomes a 1d12 + 2d8 + 13.

Some situations may benefit from boons and banes simultaneously, and allow for varying degrees of advantage/disadvantage.

#### Situation - Both Boons and Banes
Dariel is an intrepid outdoorswoman with the Journeyman rank in Survival with a Herbalist specialization. Suppose she wishes to identify a herb that may be used to treat poison, after a long and arduous day of traveling through the forests. Her specialization as a Herbalist gives her +1 boon to her roll made to identify the herb, but her state of exhaustion gives her +2 banes to her roll. The boon upgrades the first die in the 3d8 dice pool to a 1d10, and the two banes downgrade the third die to a d4, resulting in a dice pool of 1d10 + 1d8 + 1d4. Additionally, with each boon giving a flat +1 modifier, and each bane giving a flat -1 modifier, there is a net -1 modifier to the attack roll. On top of her +6 Ability bonus (an average between her Constitution and Survival), and a +6 Survival Skill Bonus, the roll for the Survival check becomes a 1d12 + 1d8 + 1d4 + 11.

> Game Masters should note that, in regards to mathematically expected outcomes, each boon will increase the average expected result by 2 and each each bane will decrease the average expected result by 2.
