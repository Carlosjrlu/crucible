# Rules for Weapon Creation

The following section describes the rules for creating a weapon which is balanced in relation to other weapon types.

1. Identify the weapon category
2. Identify the weapon quality tier
3. Identify the weapon enchantment level (if any)
4. Add any special properties

## Weapon Category

The weapon type describes its physical format and complexity of usage. Different weapon types use different scaling formulae for determining their attack roll, while more demanding weaponry generates a larger base damage formula.

| Melee Type    | Attack Scaling             | Number of Dice | Dice Denomination | AP Cost | Base Damage |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Light (1h)    | Dexterity                  | 0              | 0                 | +0      | 1d4         |
| Simple (1h)   | Strength                   | 0              | +2                | +0      | 1d6         |
| Balanced (1h) | (Strength + Dexterity) / 2 | 0              | +2                | +0      | 1d6         |
| Heavy (1h)    | Strength                   | 0              | +4                | +1      | 1d8         |
| Massive (1h)  | Strength                   | 0              | +6                | +2      | 1d10        |
| Simple (2h)   | Strength                   | +1             | +2                | +1      | 2d6         |
| Balanced (2h) | (Strength + Dexterity) / 2 | +1             | +2                | +1      | 2d6         |
| Heavy (2h)    | Strength                   | +1             | +4                | +2      | 2d8         |
| Massive (2h)  | Strength                   | +1             | +6                | +3      | 2d10        |

| Ranged Type     | Attack Scaling             | Number of Dice | Dice Denomination | AP Cost | Base Damage |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Projectile (2h) | (Strength + Dexterity) / 2 | +1             | +2                | +1      | 2d6         |
| Mechanical (1h) | Dexterity                  | 0              | +4                | +2      | 1d8         |
| Mechanical (2h) | Dexterity                  | +1             | +4                | +2      | 2d8         |
