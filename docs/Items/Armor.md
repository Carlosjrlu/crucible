**Armor Type:** The name of the armor, and the category this armor falls under. If you have neither Light, Medium, nor Heavy armor equipped, you are considered Unarmored. <br>
**Base Armor:** The base Armor this adds to your PD while worn.<br>
**Base Dodge:** The base Dodge this adds to your PD while worn.<br>
**Max Dodge:** The maximum Dodge value you can benefit from while wearing this armor.<br>
**Starting PD:** The theoretical PD of an unarmed, unskilled armor user with +3 Dexterity.<br>

## Rules for Armor Creation

The following section details steps to create a type of armor which is balanced in relation to other types of armor.

### Step 1. Determine the Base Armor value and Armor Type.

Choose a value for the Base Armor value of the new armor, and then consult the table below to find the category of armor whose Base Armor Range it falls under. Alternatively, Choose a type of armor (Light, Medium, or Heavy) and consult the table below. The Base Armor value should not exceed 22.

| Armor Type   | Base Armor Range |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Light Armor  | 3-9              |
| Medium Armor | 10-16            |
| Heavy Armor  | 17-22            |

### Step 2. Calculate the Base Dodge value.

The approximate Base Dodge value the armor should have can be calculated based on the Base Armor value using the following formula:

**Base Dodge ≈ 12 - (Base Armor / 2)**

### Step 3. Calculate the Max Dodge value.

The Max Dodge value the armor should have is calculated based on the Base Armor value using the following formula:

**Max Dodge <= 24 - Base Armor**

The value must be no higher than what is calculated using this formula, but may be 1 or 2 points lower.
