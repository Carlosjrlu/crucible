# Talents



## Basic Progression

The basics of talent progression involves investing outward through a web of interconnected nodes. Characters begin at the center of the tree with a maximum of two **Starter Nodes** which cost 2 Talent Points each. From there, players expand outward. There are several types of nodes:

| Node Type           | Cost | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Starter Node        | 2    | Starter Nodes are at the center of the tree. Characters must acquire one, and may only acquire a maximum of 2 Starter Nodes. |
| Progression Node    | 1    | Progression Nodes have multiple ranks and cost 1 Talent Point per rank to progress. Downstream nodes may require a certain rank of the previous progression node to unlock. |
| Ability Node        | 2    | Ability Nodes unlock active abilities which cost Action Points to use. |
| Specialization Node | 3    | Specialization Nodes involve alternative choices where the Character may choose between 2 or 3 alternative specializations, but may only select one. |
| Keystone Node       | 5    | Keystone Nodes represent the culmination of power related to a particular advancement concept. |

Fully mastering a thematic talent path will cost 31 points, allowing a max level character to have mastered at most 2 paths and dabbled in several others.





Example progression along the Dual Wield progression path might look like the following. 

| Tier | Node                | Cost | Cumulative |
| ---- | ------------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| 0    | Soldier             | 2    | 2          |
| 1    | Dual Wielding (5/5) | 5    | 7          |
| 1    | Twinned Strike      | 2    | 9          |
| 1    | Guard of Steel      | 3    | 12         |
