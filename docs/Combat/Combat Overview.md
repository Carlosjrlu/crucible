# Combat Overview

During exploration phases of gameplay, players and the Game Master can take turns to act interchangeably in a way that promotes fluid narrative and storytelling, often it is helpful to impose more structure on the sequence of actions and reactions which comprise a scene. This section of the guide generalizes the terminology for such situations as "combat" as battle with enemies is the foremost example, but the following rules could equally apply to other situations when having structured turns and limitations on each character's ability to act would be helpful.

> Other situations in which combat rules could be helpful might include: a chase sequence, an escape scene where the protagonists are attempting to elude pursuers or avoid danger, social encounters which impose additional structure on dialog, tavern games, or even party exploration through a dangerous area.
