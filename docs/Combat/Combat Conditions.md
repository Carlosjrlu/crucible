# Combat Conditions
The following conditions can apply to creatures when specific circumstances are met.

#### Dead
When a player character's Wounds reach their maximum value, or when a non-player character's Health reaches zero, that character is **Dead**. A character which is Dead is also treated as **Incapacitated**, can no longer Rest, and cannot be revived except by powerful magical means.

#### Engaged
When a creature is in base contact with an enemy and is not incapacitated, it is considered to have that enemy **Engaged**.

#### Exposed
Some attacks can leave an enemy temporarily vulnerable. When a creature is **Exposed** attacks against it gain +2 Boons.

#### Flanked
When a creature is **Engaged** by multiple foes which are its own size or larger and those foes are located on opposite sides of its square, the creature is considered to be **Flanked**.

#### Flanking
When you are **Engaged** with a creature that is your size or smaller that is currently **Flanked**, you gain a number of **Boons** to Attack abilities equal to the number of flanking allies.

#### Incapacitated
When a creature is entirely unable to act, it is **Inacapacitated**. There are several conditions which are also treated as Incapacitated, including **Unconscious** or **Paralyzed**. When a target is Incapacitated, attacks against it gain +4 Boons.

#### Prone
A creature that has been knocked to the ground, or has voluntarily thrown itself to the ground is considered **Prone**. Returning to your feet from a Prone position requires one Movement action. While Prone, the creature is **Exposed** against melee attacks.

#### Staggered
A creature that is **Staggered** temporarily has 1 fewer Action Point available than normal.

#### Stunned
A creature that is **Stunned** temporarily has 2 fewer Action Points available than normal.

#### Paralyzed
A creature that is **Paralyzed** is unable to perform Actions until the paralysis is ended. During this time the target is **Incapacitated**.

#### Protected
Some terrain or abilities may temporarily harden a creature's defenses. When a creature is **Protected** attacks against it suffer +2 Banes.

#### Unconscious
When a character's Health reaches zero, they become **Unconscious**. During this time they fall **Prone** and are **Incapacitated**.
