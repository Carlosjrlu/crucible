# Initiative and Turn Order

Initiative reflects your character's swiftness of mind and body - corresponding to how quickly you are able to act in a situation where time is of the essence. Your character's initiative during combat is determined by your Dexterity and Intellect attributes, any passive Initiative Bonus you may have, any situational bonus which allows you to react faster than usual, and an element of random chance. 

## Initiative Calculation
Your initiative is determined by:

```
Initiative = 3d8[Boons,Banes] + (0.5 * (Dexterity + Intelligence))
```

A situational bonus to initiative could result from you getting the drop on an enemy, or benefiting from a magical spell which hastens your reactions, alternatively you could face a situational penalty to initiative if your reactions are dulled or slowed by alchemical or magical effects.

Each round of combat you have a pool of Action Points which you may elect to spend in various ways. If you are not immobilized or incapacitated, any unspent Action Points at the end of each round are defined as action reserves which each add a **Boon** to your Initiative roll for the following round.

> Re-rolling initiative every round introduces greater tactical challenge for players who cannot rely completely upon always acting before or after the same foes each round of combat. Being able to convert unspent action points into an initiative bonus in the subsequent round can also promote creative tactical solutions to a variety of combat challenges.

### Automatic Initiative
In the Crucible system initiative is automatically rolled when the combat round advances, so you do not need to manually roll any initiative value. Your character's bonuses are automatically taken into consideration as part of this roll.
