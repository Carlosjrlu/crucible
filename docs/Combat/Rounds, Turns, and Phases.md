# Combat Rounds, Turns, and Phases

An overall combat encounter is divided into "Rounds", "Turns", and "Phases". A *Round* refers to a single set of choices made by the characters in the encounter, where each character gets to act in an order defined by their Initiative (described below). Each round loosely represents around 10 seconds of real time, where 6 rounds of combat occur each minute of combat. A *Turn* represents the actions taken by the one character whose turn it is to act in the initiative order. *Phases* are different stages of the the combat encounter and it's rounds which apply certain additional rules.

**FAQ: Why 10 second rounds instead of 6 second rounds?**

>  In systems which utilize 6 second rounds, combat duration often feels unrealistically short - with many combats resolving in under 30 seconds of time. Given the duration of many temporary effects (for example 1 minute) - combats that end in less than 1 minute of elapsed time do not present players with any tradeoff from using temporary abilities -as these abilities do not effectively expire before the end of the combat scenario. A goal of %SYSTEM% is to introduce more tradeoffs into *when* is the right time to use a talent or spell which might not last for the entire battle.

## A Combat Round

| Phase             | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Initiative Phase  | All participants in the combat roll Initiative for the Round which determines the order in which they act for that round. |
| Preparation Phase | Each participant who is able to react may choose to perform at most one Preparation Action, all of which are announced and occur simultaneously during the Preparation Phase. |
| Action Phase      | Each combatant takes a turn in the order defined by the Initiative rolls for the round. |
| Maintenance Phase | Any combatants using effects which must be maintained face checks to determine whether those effects are maintained during the Maintenance Phase. If these checks are failed, the effect ends at the end of the round and does not carry over into the next round. |

> Regarding the Preparation Phase and the honor system. Since preparation actions are intended to be simultaneous - every combatant should choose privately to themselves which preparation action they are taking and honestly announce it to the table in any order the GM prefers. Sometimes a preparation action taken by one character can be countered by the preparation made by another - it is up to the table to exercise the honor system and honestly declare which preparation action you took. If it is helpful for enforcing honesty, the Game Master could elect to have players announce in initiative order, or to write down their action on a piece of paper to reveal together.
