Spells found in D&D that may be worth implementing in some fashion into the spell system. Many spells may be better off implemented in the talent tree, rather than as actual Crucible spells.

## Cantrips
* Prestidigitation / Druidcraft / Thaumaturgy
    
    Basic magic tricks, with little/situational utility but are mostly flavorful. Extent of their utility likely depends on which gestures/runes they would use, or would simply be features on the talent tree rather than a part of the spell system itself.

## 1st Level

* Bane/Bless - Influence, Divine/Death [likely one is a Nullified version of the other, Health and Protection runes also work depending on how Bane/Bless affect health/PD]
* Alarm/Sleep - Fan, Courage [Possibly implemented as nullified versions of one another]
* Chaos Bolt - Arrow, (Unsure on rune) [projectile of random/wildcard magic energy]
* Detect Magic - Aspect, Knowledge (Infuse) [could instead be some sort of buff to Arcana checks]
* Entangle - Strike/Blast, Earth/Motion (Negate) [Could be any number of gestures as Negating the Motion rune would likely slow/pin creatures regardless of gesture. If specifically plants entangle the creature, may use Earth Rune instead?]
* Feather Fall - Aspect/Influence, Air/Motion (Negate) [slowing the fall of a creature or object]
* Jump - Aspect, Air/Motion [increasing the distance someone can leap]
* Shield - Aspect, Protection/Force [magical forcefield cast just before an attack, or series of attacks]
* Silent Image - Ray, Sense [illusion that can move and wander realistically]

## 2nd Level
* Augury - Aspect, Mind
* Barkskin - Aspect, Protection
* Beast Sense - Touch, Sense
* Blindness/Deafness - Influence, Sense (Negate)
* Blur - Aspect, Sense (Infuse)
* Darkness - Blast, Sense (Negate)
* Crown of Madness - Influence, Mind [could very well be an aspect of a certain type of charm spell] 
* Detect Thoughts - Aspect, Mind (Extend?)
* Enlarge/Reduce - Create/Influence, Motion
* Gentle Repose - Touch, Death (Negate)
* Heat Metal - Influence, Fire (Infuse?)
* Invisibility - Aspect, Sense (Negate)
* Magic Weapon - Influence, Force (Negate)
* Mirror Image - Create/Arrow, Sense
* Misty Step - Step, Air/Motion (Quicken)
* Phantasmal Force - Influence, Mind
* Scorching Ray - Arrow, Fire (Enlarge)
* Silence - Blast, Sense (Negate)
* Spider Climb - Aspect, Earth (Infuse?)
* Spiritual Weapon - Aspect, Force (Infuse?)
* Web - Blast, (Literally no idea for rune)

## 3rd Level
* Animate Dead - Arrow/Blast, Death (Negate)
* Blink - Step, Force/Protection
* Call Lightning - Blast, Air (Empower/Infuse) [Non-infused version maybe just a sustained gust of wind?]
* Clairvoyance - Blast, Knowledge
* Conjure Animals [likely a summons feature]
* Counterspell & Dispel Magic [General Negate-type metamagics]
* Daylight - Blast, Sense
* Fireball - Blast, Fire
* Fly - Aspect, Air [Gaseous Form & Wind Walk could use stronger gestures/metamagic]
* Haste - Create/Influence, Motion
* Lightning Bolt - Ray, Air
* Major Image - Conjure, Sense
* Plant Growth - Blast/Create, Earth/Health
* Revivify - Strike, Health (Infuse) [Maybe only infused/empowered inflections have the ability to restore dead creatures' HP]
* Sending - Step, Knowledge
* Slow - Create/Influence, Motion (Negate) [Maybe an ice rune spell if it's not the direct opposite of Haste?]

## 4th Level
* Confusion - Blast, Mind
* Dimension Door - Step, Force
* Freedom of Movement - Create/Influence, Motion [Infused version of Haste?]
* Phantasmal Killer - Create, Courage (Negate)
* Polymorph [Talent tree feature?]

## 5th Level
* Awaken - Create, Mind (weaker versions could be similar to Animate Object, etc.)
* Bigby's Hand - Influence, Force
* Cloudkill - Create, Earth/Death (Sustain) [Lingering AoE spells like clouds & debuffs could use Sustain-like metamagics?]
* Cone of Cold - Fan, Ice
* Contagion - Touch, Death (Sustain)
* Raise Dead - Touch, Health (Infuse/Empower) [See Revivify]
* Telekinesis - Influence/Aspect, Force
* Wall of Force - Wall, Force [Fairly obvious]

## 6th Level
* Arcane Gate - Create, Motion, Infuse [Perhaps movement-based spells turn into actual teleports when infused/empowered?]
* Chain Lightning - Arrow, Air [Extend/Infuse/Empower might be what causes the lightning to "chain" to other targets]
* Disintegrate - Arrow, Fire/Force (Empower)
* Globe of Invulnerability - Blast/Influence, Protection [Should probably provide bonuses to saves for creatures within its area, rather than flat-out deny any spells affecting them]
* True Seeing - Aspect, Sense/Knowledge
* Wall of Thorns - Wall, Earth? [Perhaps a Nature rune is necessary, as a Wall of Earth/Stone would also use these components]
* Wind Walk - Aspect, Air (Extend) [See Fly]

## 7th Level
* Etherealness - Aspect, Force (Infuse) [Really only makes sense if interplanar travel / parallel dimensions are baked into the system the same way they are in 5e]

* Simulacrum [likely a summons feature]

* Earthquake - Blast, Earth
* Mind Blank - Aspect, Mind (Nullify/Extend)
* Sunburst - Blast, Divine [Alternatively, Light (Infuse/Empower)]
* Tsunami - Blast/Wave, Ice?

## 9th Level
* Gate - Create, Motion (Infuse) [See Arcane Gate, Plane Shift, Teleport]
* Meteor Swarm - Blast, Fire
* True Resurrection - Touch, Health (Sustain/Infuse) [See Revivify, Raise Dead]
