# Spellcasting and Components

Spellcasting in <SYSTEM> uses a novel and flexible system of spellcasting. A wielder of arcane power creates a spell by making a certain **Gesture** while tracing a specific **Rune**. The resulting spell can be further modified using vocal **Metamagic** which alters the resulting effects.

## Spell Gestures
