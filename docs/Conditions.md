# Combat Maneuvers, Conditions, and Effects



## Maneuvers

#### Disarm

You attempt to disarm your opponent of a weapon or item held in their hands. The difficult of the disarm attempt depends on the type of weapon or object.

| Target Object                             | Situational Penalty |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| One-handed weapon or similar-sized object | No penalty          |
| Two-handed weapon or similar-sized object | -2 penalty          |
| Small object (held inside palm)           | -5 penalty          |

If successful, your opponent is immediately disarmed and the target object falls to the ground. 

#### Grapple

You attempt to physically restrain or subdue an opponent, testing your strength against theirs. Perform a **Contest of Strength** (further details needed). If successful, your opponent is **Restrained**. If your opponent is also **Prone** they instead become **Pinned**.

#### Trip

You attempt to unbalance your opponent, depriving them of their normal posture. Perform a Contest of Dexterity (further details needed). If successful, your opponent is tripped and falls **Prone**. If your opponent is also **Restrained** they instead become **Pinned**.
